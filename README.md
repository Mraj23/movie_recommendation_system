# ML Project to build better recommendation systems

## File descriptions

The main script is called Metadata implementation.
The rest of the files are metadata information or preprocessing tools.
The datasets themselves could not be added to the repository because they were too large in size, can be found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset
These models were trained on a subset of this entire dataset.
